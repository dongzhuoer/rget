# Innovation

This package doesn't aim to replace wget. It just want to implement
    the minimal function of grab a simple website.

Why I want to write this package rather than use existing **wget**. **wget** just download `www.foo.com/bar/index.html` to `./www.foo.com/bar` , and then overwrite that file to a folder while downloading other HTML files in `www.foo.com/bar/` . I just want to ask whether you want to cry.
